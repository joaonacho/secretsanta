Have you ever used Secret Santa generators? Full of ads and complicated to use, right?
So we had this idea of making one Secret Santa app without complications and with extra features that are going to make the user experience better. You can use it to make groups with your closest friends, limit your gift price and send group messages to organize the event. After that, you just have to shuffle the group and press the button "send emails" to discover who is your webstie! :wink:

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Biggest Learnings 📖

#### With this project I wanted to deepen my knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript:
* []() **Object Oriented Programming** (OOP) - concepts of object, class and methods and their use through the constructor method and functions.
* []() Concept of **Inheritance** and the two types of classes - parent classes and child classes through the keywords "extend" and "super".
* []() Class **Hoisting** - using the keyword "new" to declare a class
* []() Reinforcement of **logical thinking** by planning the game and its features.
* []() Reviewed **DOM Manipulation** concepts
* []() **"this" Keyword** - learned the different contexts in which the keyword is used and how it behaves


#### It also helped me to learn more about design tools like:
* []() Adobe Ilustrator -  for creating the different layers of the background and the visuals for the players and enemies
* []() DragonBones - It was my first experience with this software that allowed me to create the spritesheets for animate the player
